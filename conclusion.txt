I feel comfortable coding in C as i am familiar with it compared to other languages 
As Dijkstra's goal is to find the optimal path , itcannot work with negative weights, since it cannot find the optimal path.
Prims and Kruskal are working fine but in some cases the less weight value ignores the connectivity between two nodes.
Prim’s algorithm assumes that all vertices are connected. But in a directed graph, every node is not reachable from every other node. So, Prim’s algorithm fails due to this reason.Kruskal algorithm fails to detect cycle in a connected graph.
So in certain cases Kruskal assumes that there is a cycle if evn there is not and fails due to that case.
